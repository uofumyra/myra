Supported OSes
=====================================
The following Operating Systems are currently supported
   
   * Linux x86_64

Recommended Architecture
=====================================
We recommend a tiered architecture consisting of 3 servers, although
the installation will work perfectly fine on a single machine

   * A database server (MySQL)
   * A repository server (Alfresco)
   * A web server (Drupal)

Requirements
=====================================
The following are required in order to start the installation
process of MyRA

   * Java JDK 1.6+
   * Apache Maven 3.0+
   * Apache Web Server 2.2.17+
   * MySQL 5.5.8+
   * PHP 5.3.5+
   * Drush 7.x-4.4+
   * Drush Make 6.x-2.2+

1. Database
====================================
Create a username and database for both Alfresco and Drupal

mysql> create database alfresco;
mysql> create user 'alfresco'@'localhost' identified by 'A_STRONG_PASSWORD';
mysql> grant all on alfresco.* to 'alfresco'@'localhost' identified by 'A_STRONG_PASSWORD';

mysql> create database drupal;
mysql> create user 'drupal'@'localhost' identified by 'A_STRONG_PASSWORD';
mysql> grant all on drupal.* to 'drupal'@'localhost' identified by 'A_STRONG_PASSWORD';

2. Alfresco
====================================
Execute the Alfresco installer within the repository
server and follow the prompts

nobody@repository:~/$ ./myra.alfresco.install

Copy the final folder where you installed alfresco to a standard
location.

For security purposes, you may want to create an additional
user to run Alfresco.

To start Alfresco, execute ./alfresco.sh start within the Alfresco
directory

3. Drupal
====================================
Execute the Drupal installer within the web server
environment and follow the prompts

nobody@webserver:~/$ ./myra.drupal.install

Copy the contents of the drupal directory to the root
of your Apache server (typically /var/www/html, htdocs, or public_html)

4. Content
====================================
Since the MyRA Drupal front end is backed by an Alfresco backend
we need to start the Alfresco repository server before we can add
content to the Drupal front end. Otherwise, we won't benefit from
the advantages that Alfresco brings us.

   * Navigate to where you've installed Alfresco and execute ./alfresco.sh start

NOTE: Be patient, Alfresco may take a few minutes for the initial start up

   * Navigate to where you've installed Drupal and execute drush ne-import /path/to/myra_content.php

5. Final Notes
===================================
None
