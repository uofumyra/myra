<h3>University Writing Center For Grant Writing Assistance</h3>
<p>The purpose of the <a href="http://www.writingcenter.utah.edu/">University Writing Center</a> is to assist students,  staff, and faculty in understanding, assessing, and improving their  writing processes and strategies. We believe this purpose is maximized  in an environment enriched with support, encouragement, and purposeful  creativity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The University Writing Center employs both undergraduate and graduate  student consultants from a variety of departments. Consultants possess a  high level of skill and receive extensive and on-going theoretical and  pedagogical education.</p>

<p>During one-to-one conversations, University Writing Center  consultants help writers discover what they know and need to know in  order to communicate more effectively in various textual modes and  rhetorical situations.&nbsp;Staff members and consultants are committed to  respectful intercultural exchanges as they assist writers in developing  and deepening academic knowledges for the benefit of the university,  home communities, and the world.&nbsp;We celebrate the pursuit of writing to  learn across curriculums, disciplines, and genres.</p>

<h3>Grant Writer Network (GWN)</h3>
<p>The Grant Writing Network (GWN), organized by the vice president for  research, is made up of professionals who assist faculty in the  preparation of grant proposals. The GWN meets monthly to share  information on available resources, to assess and create needed  resources, to share ideas, and to provide general support and guidance  for the community of grant writers and coordinators across campus.  Access to <a href="https://www.unite.utah.edu/Overview.html">grant writing templates</a> including the updated NIH SF 424 forms are on the UNITE site (use your  current CIS username and password to login).

<h3>Utah Population Database (UPDB)</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hci.utah.edu/groups/ppr/" target="_blank">Utah Population Database</a> at the University of Utah is one of the world’s richest sources of  in-depth information that supports research on genetics, epidemiology,  demography, and public health. For more than 30 years, researchers at the University of Utah and other  institutions have used UPDB to identify and study individuals and  families that have higher than normal incidence of cancer or other  diseases, to analyze patterns of genetic inheritance, and to identify  specific genetic mutations.</p>
<p>The UPDB is the only  database of its kind in the United States and one of few such resources in the world.</p>
<h3>FURTHeR</h3>
<p>A major component of the CCTS is the Biomedical Informatics Core (BMIC), headed by Dr. Joyce Mitchell, PhD, Associate Vice President for Health Sciences IT and Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics.&nbsp; BMIC is charged with creating the informatics infrastructure for supporting this profoundly new approach to conducting biomedical research.&nbsp; BMIC’s primary objective is to create and sustain a <em>statewide</em> set of interconnected data resources that link genotypic, phenotypic, genealogic, and health care data from all three of the major healthcare delivery networks in Utah (the University of Utah Healthcare System; Intermountain Healthcare; and the Veterans Administration Salt Lake City Health System), as well as environmental and public health data from the Utah Department of Health. &nbsp;Covering well over 85% of the State’s clinical data and nearly 100% of the State’s diverse public health data, this remarkable array of data will be integrated with Utah’s unique genealogical and demographic resource, the Utah Population Database.&nbsp; Directed by Dr. Scott  Narus, PhD, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics, this project is exploring innovative methods for federating the diverse data resources from the partner institutions into a <em>virtual</em> repository known as the <em>Federated Utah Research and Translational Health e-Repository</em> (FURTHeR).</p>
<p>We are already accessing data sources and have performed pilot cohort studies in diabetes, pre-eclampsia and psoriasis. The system will be ready for selected pilot researcher use by the end of 2010.</p>

<h3>R&amp;D Dashboard</h3>
<p>The Office of Science and Technology Policy has launched a beta version of the new <a href="http://rd-dashboard.nitrd.gov/">R&amp;D Dashboard</a>, an online tool that allows the public to track U.S. progress in innovation. The Dashboard website helps users document and demonstrate the impacts of federal investment in research and development. The beta version of the site, currently tracking Federal investment in NIH and the NSF over the past decade, presents data on Federal R&amp;D awards to research institutions and links those inputs to outputs - specifically publications, patent applications, and patents produced by researchers funded by those investments. The site can sort investments at the state, congressional district, and research-institution levels.</p>

<h3>Utah Population Database (UPDB)</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hci.utah.edu/groups/ppr/" target="_blank">Utah Population Database</a> at the University of Utah is one of the world’s richest sources of  in-depth information that supports research on genetics, epidemiology,  demography, and public health. For more than 30 years, researchers at the University of Utah and other  institutions have used UPDB to identify and study individuals and  families that have higher than normal incidence of cancer or other  diseases, to analyze patterns of genetic inheritance, and to identify  specific genetic mutations.</p>
<p>The UPDB is the only  database of its kind in the United States and one of few such resources in the world.</p>
<h3>FURTHeR</h3>
<p>A major component of the CCTS is the Biomedical Informatics Core (BMIC), headed by Dr. Joyce Mitchell, PhD, Associate Vice President for Health Sciences IT and Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics.  BMIC is charged with creating the informatics infrastructure for supporting this profoundly new approach to conducting biomedical research.  BMIC’s primary objective is to create and sustain a <em>statewide</em> set of interconnected data resources that link genotypic, phenotypic, genealogic, and health care data from all three of the major healthcare delivery networks in Utah (the University of Utah Healthcare System; Intermountain Healthcare; and the Veterans Administration Salt Lake City Health System), as well as environmental and public health data from the Utah Department of Health.  Covering well over 85% of the State’s clinical data and nearly 100% of the State’s diverse public health data, this remarkable array of data will be integrated with Utah’s unique genealogical and demographic resource, the Utah Population Database.  Directed by Dr. Scott  Narus, PhD, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics, this project is exploring innovative methods for federating the diverse data resources from the partner institutions into a <em>virtual</em> repository known as the <em>Federated Utah Research and Translational Health e-Repository</em> (FURTHeR).</p>
<p>We are already accessing data sources and have performed pilot cohort studies in diabetes, pre-eclampsia and psoriasis. The system will be ready for selected pilot researcher use by the end of 2010.</p>

<h3>Community Engagement</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://communityengagement.genetics.utah.edu/" target="_blank">Community Engagement core</a> of the University\'s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) mission is establish a pre-eminent program of participatory research that involves  the exchange of knowledge, experience, and values through community and  organizational partnerships in order to benefit the health of  individuals and populations at local, regional, and national levels.</p><br>

<h3>Intermountain Healthcare Patient Information</h3>
<p><a href="http://intermountainhealthcare.org/qualityandresearch/researchmanagement/forpatients/Pages/home.aspx">Intermountain Healthcare</a> provides research opportunities to our patients, with the voluntary  option to participate. Supporting research furthers knowledge and  advances medical discovery.<br>

Before you are identified as a potential research participant,  Intermountain Healthcare’s Office of Research reviews and approves the  project.</p><br>

<h3>DIRECT</h3>
<p>Discovery of potential collaborators is a priority of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Consortium.&nbsp; At the new DIRECT site (<a href="http://direct2experts.org/">http://direct2experts.org</a>), you can search multiple institutions simultaneously and then easily explore the results at each institution on their individual sites. &nbsp;This pilot project of the CTSA Research Networking group takes advantage of the availability of researcher profile tools at many CTSAs and other institutions.&nbsp; The next stage of project is to provide an integrated search across all participating institutions.</p><br>

<h3>Research Portal</h3>
<p>Research Portal can be accessed through the Campus Information  System, via the “Employee” page, under the “Research Administration”  section. Select the link titled “Research Portal” to launch the  application.<br><br>
Key features of Research Portal include:<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Online submission of Limited Competition pre-proposals.

<h3>Overbuilding Research Capacity</h3>
<p>Are we <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5997/1257.summary" target="_blank">overbuilding research capacity</a>? Policies that offer incentives for individuals and institutions can unintentionally induce harmful behaviors. One such perverse incentive encourages U.S. universities, medical centers, and other research institutions to expand their research capacities indefinitely through funds derived from National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants. A reliance on the NIH to pay not only the salaries of scientists but also the overhead (or indirect) costs of building construction and maintenance has become a way of life at many U.S. research institutions, with potential painful consequences. The current trajectory is unsustainable, threatening to produce a glut of laboratory facilities reminiscent of the real estate bust of 2008 and, worse, a host of exhausted scientists with no means of support. </p><br>

<h3>Engaging Basic Scientists in Translational Research</h3>
<p>On March 24-25, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) brought together leaders of the scientific community for a two-day symposium to explore ways to engage basic scientists in translational research. Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the NIH, delivered the opening address, discussing the barriers to translating fundamental knowledge into new drugs and devices, the critical contributions that basic investigators make to translation research, and the role that NIH, particularly through the proposed National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, will play in promoting the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics. FASEB’s steering committee that organized the meeting is now focused on developing a white paper describing the major recommendations that emerged from the meeting.

<h3>Randomized Clinical Trials (RCT)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/training/con-ed/rct-ibi-2011.htm">RCT</a>\'s objective is to provide a thorough grounding in the conduct of randomized clinical  trials to researchers and health professionals interested in developing competence in the planning, design, and execution of  randomized clinical trials involving behavioral interventions. The curriculum will enable participants to:</p>
<p>&raquo; Describe the principles underlying the conduct of unbiased clinical trials.
&raquo; Identify the unique challenges posed by behavioral randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
&raquo; Evaluate alternative RCT designs in terms of their appropriateness to scientific and clinical goals.
&raquo; Select appropriate strategies for enrollment, randomization, and retention of participants.
&raquo; Understand methods for monitoring, coordinating, and conducting RCTs.
&raquo; Develop strategies for appropriate statistical analyses of RCT data.
&raquo; Evaluate the quality of behavioral RCTs and interpret their results.
&raquo; Design a RCT research project in collaboration with a scientific team.<br></p>

<h3>Community Engagement Faculty Institute</h3>
<p><a href="http://communityengagement.genetics.utah.edu/?p=578" target="_blank">The Faculty Institute</a> features hands-on workshops and skill development opportunities in the areas of Engagement, Community Partnerships and Research. Workshop topics include helping engaged scholars find funding,locate publication outlets, and build sustainable partnerships.</p>
<h3>CCTS Masters of Science in Clinical Investigation (msci)</h3>
<p>The  <a href="http://www.ccts.utah.edu/education/?pageId=3290">MSCI</a> degree program provides classroom and mentored research experience  in clinical research, preparing its trainees for careers in clinical  investigation, both in academic medicine and the allied health sciences.  The program prepares trainees to be competitive investigators capable  of gaining extramural funding for their clinical research projects. The  curriculum of the MSCI focuses on the theories, models, methods, and  tools used by investigators who conduct bench-to-bedside and  bedside-to-community translational research. Candidates for the MSCI  degree will elect one of two areas of emphasis or "tracks". The first  track emphasizes the inherited basis of human disease,  mechanism-oriented clinical research, and bench-to-bedside translational  research. The second track emphasizes epidemiology, health services  research, and bedside-to-community translational research. The program  is designed to support a mentored research experience for fellows and  junior faculty members at the University of Utah School of Medicine and  allied health science fields.</p>
